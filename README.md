Moving forward, all of my projects will be hosted [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/konvoulgaris) and this profile will simply act as an index of links that lead to the actual repositories. **They will not be mirrors.**

This is due to [the announcement of Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) and while I have many thoughts about the approach that Microsoft/GitHub has chosen to follow, I will keep those to myself for the time being and eventually release an article covering most of it.

If you wish to see ***some*** of my concerns now, feel free to watch [this video by the Engineer Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9u3ZAGQmT0).
